# Toolkit for TSV (Tab-Separated Value) files

This toolkit is for making daily life easy on manipulation TSV files, including but not limited to loading, saving, viewing, subsetting, filtering, sorting, transposing, merging, joining the table-format files. In addition to TSV format, CSV, Excel (.xslx) and other common-using bioinformatics formats (such as BED, PSL) are also supported.

## Quick Installation

This toolkit is written by Perl, with minimum dependency on 3rd party packages/libraries. For fully functions, only a few perl packages are required, and it is easy to install them by CPAN.

The recommended way to install 'tsv' is by clone it from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/yanlinlin82/tsv
```

and then add the 'tsv' directory to your environment variable PATH.

Alternatively, you can download only the 'tsv' file to any directory you want (and also add the directory to PATH):

```
# cd <any-path-you-want-to-put-tsv-in>
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanlinlin82/tsv/master/tsv
chmod +x tsv
./tsv install # this command will create symbolic links to assist command line operations
```
